We update SelfSim to SelfSim-EV (an EV version) to simulate the diffusion of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Beijing from 2018 to 2030 considering, for example, the influences of population dynamics, land use changes and residential relocations on the uptake of EVs. 

Based on the simulation, we can obtain:
1) simulation results about urban dynamics (i.e., how the urban sub-systems involved, including transportation, land use, population and economy systems) co-evolve over time, considering their interactions)
SelfSim Outputs: Urban Dynamics

2) simulation results about how the EVs diffuse over time and across space. To initialize the SelfSim-EV model, we use both traditional survey data (e.g., survey on EV choice behavior), and urban big data (e.g., social media data).
