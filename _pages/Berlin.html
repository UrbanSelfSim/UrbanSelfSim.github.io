<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Description</b></p>
<p>We developed a SelfSim Berlin scenario to simulate how its urban system evolves over time from 2021 to 2030. The scaling factor is 1: 300 (which means each agent in the simulation represents 300 persons in reality). The model was calibrated by comparing the observed and simulated housing selling prices and rents, and firm rents from 2021 to 2023. Their mean absolute errors were 1.0%、18.7%、10.79%, respectively. </p>
