We applied SelfSim to London to simulate the evolution of its urban system from 2021 to 2030, using a scaling factor of 1:1000 (where each agent represents 1,000 people). The model was calibrated by comparing observed and simulated sale and rental prices of residential buildings between 2021 and 2023. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) were 3.0% and 2.4%, respectively.
