We developed a SelfSim New York City scenario to simulate how its urban system evolves over time from 2021 to 2030. The scaling factor is 1:1000 (i.e., each agent in the simulation represents 1000 people in reality). The model is calibrated by comparing the observed and simulated housing selling prices and rents, and firm rents from 2021 to 2023. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) were 2.1%, 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively.
