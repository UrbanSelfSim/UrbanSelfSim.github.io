We applied SelfSim to Shenzhen, simulating how its urban system would evolve over time from 2021 to 2030. The scaling factor is 1:1000 (i.e., each agent in the simulation represents 1000 people in reality). The model is calibrated by comparing the observed and simulated home sale prices and population distributions between 2021 and 2023. The mean absolute percentage errors(MAPE) were 9.2% and 4.7%, respectively.
