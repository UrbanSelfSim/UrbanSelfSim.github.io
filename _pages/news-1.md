On Thursday, 29 February 2024, Dr. Chengxiang ZHUGE was invited to deliver a research seminar in the Department of Geography & Resource Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The title of the research seminar was ‘Interlinked Low-Carbon Travel and Residential Behaviour: Energy, Climate, Social and Infrastructural Impacts’.

Dr. Zhuge presented the idea of exploring interlinked energy use and technology purchase behaviors across travel and residential domains (e.g., choice of car or commuting mode, and adoption of heating or cooling technology or smart devices in homes) based on an agent-based urban simulation model (i.e., SelfSim).
