Our research group is pleased to announce the research paper “Consumers' attitudes toward benefits and drawbacks of vehicle-to-grid technology: An agent-based model” has been published in the International Journal of Sustainable Transportation in August 2025! Please click [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/15568318.2025.2546033) to read the full paper. 

This study first investigated public attitudes toward the key benefits and drawbacks of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology using survey data from Beijing. These findings were then incorporated into a spatial agent-based model to simulate how changes in consumer attitudes might influence V2G adoption.

Key findings include:
1.	Respondents were most concerned about battery degradation and least concerned about the benefit of grid support.
2.	Mitigating BEV owners’ concerns about battery degradation and enhancing public awareness of the cost-saving potential of V2G can significantly increase the number of people will/may adopt V2G with a BEV and a PHEV, respectively.
3.	Despite these increases in potential adopters, the attitudinal improvements do not lead to a notable rise in the number of actual V2G adopters.
4.	V2G technology is adopted more easily by PHEV owners than by BEV owners.

This research provides valuable insights for shaping policies to promote the adoption of V2G.
