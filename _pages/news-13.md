She presented Hong Kong as a case study, demonstrating how SelfSim can model solar PV adoption under different policy scenarios. This research is based on a master dissertation by Jason under the supervision of Dr. Zhuge.

The talk highlighted the power of geospatial data and simulation tools in driving evidence-based smart city planning and energy transition strategies.
