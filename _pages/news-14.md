Our research group is pleased to announce that the research paper “Market potential of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in Beijing: a spatial agent-based model approach” has been published in Transportation in October 2025! Please click [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-025-10683-w) to read the full paper.

This study developed a spatial agent-based model calibrated with survey data from 1,065 respondents in Beijing to investigate the market evolution of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (HFCVs) under different policy and market scenarios.

Key findings include:
- Under current conditions, both HFCV adoption and hydrogen station deployment remain limited, despite increases of 37.5% in applicants and 15.63% in market share. 
- Consumer perceptions regarding cost, social influence, and environmental benefits play a greater role in promoting HFCV uptake than infrastructure availability. 
- Subsidies for HFCV purchases are more impactful than technological learning rates, significantly accelerating market entry. 
- The diffusion of HFCVs substantially affects the market performance of battery electric vehicles.

This research provides valuable insights for breaking the diffusion dilemma of the HFCV market.
