Our SelfSim research group is very glad to inform you that Dr. Chengxiang Zhuge and Justin Hayse Chiwing G. Tang have together published a book chapter titled “The potential diffusion and economic impacts of private autonomous vehicles: A spatial agent-based model” in the book Handbook of Geospatial Approaches to Sustainable Cities (Chapter 16), with Prof. Qihao Weng as the main book editor. This research presents an agent-based autonomous vehicle (AV) diffusion model that simulates how private AVs diffuse over time and space at the micro scale in Beijing. Using the model, the research explored how AVs would potentially diffuse under reference, policy, and price scenarios, and how AV diffusion would influence housing expenses saved (through residential relocation with AVs) and in-vehicle work, which are two typical types of economic impact. Understanding the potential diffusion of AVs and its impacts would be advantageous for stakeholders involved in the AV industry, including vehicle manufacturers, policymakers, and infrastructure companies.
