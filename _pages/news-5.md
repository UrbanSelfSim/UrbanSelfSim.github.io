Our SelfSim research group is pleased to announce the research paper “Exploring the potential adoption of Mobility-as-a-Service in Beijing: A spatial agent-based model” has been published in Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice in April 2025! This study developed a spatial agent-based model to simulate the adoption and subscription of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) in Beijing. The model included four MaaS plans, including pay-as-you-go, monthly, season, and yearly subscriptions. Several key findings include:
1. Approximately 79.6% of respondents expressed interest in MaaS, despite 39.1% being unfamiliar with the concept.
2. Monthly subscriptions and pay-as-you-go plans were the most popular, while season and yearly plans received fewer subscriptions.
3. Season subscribers were predominantly located in the inner and outer suburbs.
4. High-intensity MaaS-related advertising significantly influenced adoption initially but had limited long-term impact.

This research provides valuable insights for MaaS companies, transport planners, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in shaping the future of shared mobility.
