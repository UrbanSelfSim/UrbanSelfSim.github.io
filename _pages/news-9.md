A three-year MaaS Project led by Dr. Tony ZHUGE (PI of this SelfSim Project) was recently funded by the MTR Research Funding Scheme 2025 (see https://www.mtracademy.com/script/en/research/index.aspx).

The full project title is “MTR-centric Mobility as a Service (MaaS-MTR) for the intercity-intracity integrated travel in the greater bay area: Travellers’ behavioural adaption and sustainability impact assessment”. Within this project, the project team will develop a set of mobile app, simulation models, impact assessment methods, and future scenarios for MaaS-MTR using Hong Kong-Shenzhen as study area.
