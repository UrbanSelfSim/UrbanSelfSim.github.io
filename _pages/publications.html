<p>Here is a list of publications relevant to SelfSim, as well as its extensions and applications (for different low-carbon technologies and/or different real-world cases) . Please note that SelfSim (including its key modules) keeps being improved and updated, and may also be adapted to specific scenarios. Thus, you may find different versions of SelfSim and its key modules in the published work.</p>
